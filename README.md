I've noticed that even the official documentation of certain third party repositories either have outdated istructions or do ertain things in non optimal ways. Sometimes to the effect of not being able to update the newly added source to cache on modern versions apt.
I then tried to be usefull while practicng bit of bash scripting.
I have no idea about the licencing or such, anyone can do whatever they want with it. Just don't be ugly trolls and harm people in any way then it's cool and please do whatever is the easiest for you at that time if you want to want to fix this practicing  or that.
