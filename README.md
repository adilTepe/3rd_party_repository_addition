properly-apt-source is an hubmle trial adding some extra sources to your apt repositories the proper way. I felt the urge to code the script as none of the existing official walkthroughs of the 3rd party repositories were able to do the thing properly for the never versions of apt.

"proper" as in https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty
